#### By _**{Brittany Rausch}**_

## Description

_{This is a .Net exercise made for Epicodus that included web api practice .This is a personal portfolio that includes github api functionality. There are three pages to this website: home, about and projects. Home is a basic navigation page, about has a basic bio, and projects has my top 3 starred github repositories. The projects page works through an api that  connects to my personal account at github and pulls all the starred repositories I have listed. Once the repositories are pulled, I put them in order of the most stars first, and then the most recently updated.  Once that order was determined, only the first 3 repositories are shown.}_
